## Description

Single Page Application that uses the Spotify API. The App displays different kinds of data depending on your music listening history like:
* Top Genres
* Top Tracks
* Top Artists
* Top Track Analysis(e.g. Speechiness, Danceability)
* Most Popular Artists or Tracks
* Decades of your Top Tracks displayed in percentages
* Individual tracks Analysis data

The coolest feature in our oppinion is the Create A Playlist page. You can use the page to generate a custom playlist and save it in your Spotify profile based on a Track you love. You can select different attributes for the playlist like: 

* Acousticness
* Danceability
* Energy
* Instrumentalness
* Liveness
* Popularity
* Speechiness

We implemented an embedded Spotify player, so you can play each track you want to directly in our webpage.
